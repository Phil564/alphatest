            <br>I am currently working on filling this repository/website with recreations of one of the old sites uses on the Minecraft Alpha 1.0.16 Versions YouTube channel. For now, only 3 versions of the pages are avaliable. 2 of them are unfinished recreations and 2 of them are the most recent versions of the pages (which aren't recreations).
            <br>Please note that I am not affiliated to the Minecraft Alpha 1.0.16 Versions YouTube channel, nor participating to the "ARG".
